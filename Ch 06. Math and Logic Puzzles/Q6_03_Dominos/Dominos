6.4 Ants on a Triangle
There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume
that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen,
and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.


- Polygon is located a two-dimensional space where each vertex connects two edges
- Each ant has two options
- Ants choose independently
- There are 2^n ways to do it

- No collision occurs if all ants start walking clockwise or anti-clockwise
- There is 2 ways to do it

- Hence, the probability of collision is: (all possibilities - no collision) / (all possibilities) = (2^n - 2) / 2^n
- (2^n - 2) / 2^n = 2^(-n)*(2^n - 2) = 1 - 2^(1 - n)
- The more vertices, the bigger the likelihood of a collision
- For a triangle, the probability of a collision is (2^3 - 2) / (2^3) = 6 / 8 = 0.75
