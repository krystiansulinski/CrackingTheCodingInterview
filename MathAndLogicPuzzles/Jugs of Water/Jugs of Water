6.5 Jugs of Water
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but
no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs
are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

five-quart jug: 5QJ
three-quart jug: 3QJ
