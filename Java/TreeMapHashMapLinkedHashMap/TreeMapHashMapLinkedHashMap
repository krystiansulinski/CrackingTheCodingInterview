13.5 TreeMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap: Explain the differences between
TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap. Provide an example of when each one
would be best.

HashMap
- implemented by an array of linked lists
- unordered
- O(1) lookup and insertion
- can be used to store authors and books

TreeMap
- implemented by a Red-Black Tree
- sorted
- O(logn) lookup and insertion
- can be used to store authors and their books in an alphabetical order

LinkedHashMap
- implemented by a doubly-linked buckets
- keys ordered by their insertion order
- O(1) lookup and insertion
- can be used to store authors and books if we want to for example display
their 3 last added books
