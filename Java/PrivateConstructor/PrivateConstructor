13.1 Private Constructor: In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

A class with a private constructor can be inherited by its own or it's parent's inner classes only.

// This code is valid:
public class OuterClass {
	OuterClass() {
		InnerClassA a = new InnerClassA();
	}

	class InnerClassA {
		private InnerClassA() {
		}

		class InnerInnerClassB extends InnerClassA {
		}
	}

	class InnerClassB extends InnerClassA {
	}
}
