13.6 Object Reflection: Explain what object reflection is in Java
and why it is useful.

Object reflection is the possibility to find out about object's class, methods, attributes etc. during the runtime.
It is useful because it allows the language to be more dynamic and determine, for example, what object's method
could be called during the runtime. It also allows to access object's private methods from outside of the object itself.
