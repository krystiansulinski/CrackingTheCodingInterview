11.3 Chess Test
We have the following method used in a chess game:
boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y). This method is part of the Piece class
and returns whether or not the piece can move to position (x, y).
Explain how you would test this method.

My answer:
I would start by testing all possible moves for each chess piece
(pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)
from the middle (D4 or E4) of an empty chessboard.

I would then check all possible moves for each chess piece with white and black sets
at the start of the game.

I would then repeat it for a randomly generated chess board state.

I would see if the method returns false for negative numbers or
greater than 8 (chess are set on an 8x8 grid).

A good case would also be to test against moving to the current position.
