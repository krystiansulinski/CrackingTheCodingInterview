11.4 No Test Tools
How would you load test a webpage without using any test tools?

Answer:
I would ask many people at the organisation to use the webpage at the same time.
Alternatively, I would hire a 3-rd party to perform the load tests.
Depending on the website, we could generate peak times by creating an advert 
at some social network website and creating a discount/occasion tied to a specific time
so that potential users would be treated as test tools.
That'd be risky for the company reputation though.

We could also do it the software-way, by changing API calls to repeat X number of times
for just one user and slowing down Internet connection.

Book answer:
We can create our own tools. For example, we could simulate
concurrent users by creating thousands of virtual users.
We would write a multi-threaded program with thousands of threads, where each
thread acts as a real-world user loading the page. For each user,
we would programmatically measure response time, data I/O, etc.
