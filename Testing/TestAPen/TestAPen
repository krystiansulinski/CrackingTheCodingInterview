11.5 Test a Pen
How would you test a pen?

I would ask:
	- Who is the user?
		- Could be a student, engineer, writer, doctor, astronaut, diver, Indiana Jones, kids,
		  elderly people, etc.
	- How the user is going to use it?
		- Could write student notes, draft sketches, paint, used under water, 
		  in extreme temperatures or pressures, to throw into a target, as a one-time pen
		  by during a pandemic or occasionally over long periods of time, etc. Could be used
		  to open boxes, as a 007 gadget device...


Depends on that, we could use some tools to generate the user.
For example, to simulate a student, we would give free pens to students
and ask for quick feedback in return after some time.

If the pen is for general public, we could just give away lots of pens to random people,
ask them to write something and give immediate feedback. We could create a lottery for all pens
where one of the people that give feedback after some time would win some prize.

If we don't have time, we could attach the pen to some machine, like a 3D printer
and simulate hours of writing. We would also throw it so some machine,
like a sophisticated washing machine to simulate unstable conditions.

We could spill milk and tea on it, step on it, throw from some distance.
