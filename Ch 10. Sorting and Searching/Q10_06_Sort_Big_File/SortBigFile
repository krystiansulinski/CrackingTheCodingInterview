10.6 Sort Big File
Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.

It depends what the strings consist of, how long they are, whether there are duplicates,
how they are initially ordered as well as space and time limitations.
 
For example, if they were made of English lower case letters only
with relatively equal chunks of strings started with same letters,
we could create buckets for them (for example 52 buckets such as: [aa-am], [am-az] etc.),
sort them one by one on different threads (for example using QuickSort),
and merge at the end.

The trick is to figure out how to best split the file.
