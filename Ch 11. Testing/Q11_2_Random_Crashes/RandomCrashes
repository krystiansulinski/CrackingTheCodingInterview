11.2 Random Crashes
You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is run.
After running it ten times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place.
The application is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library.
What programming errors could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?

My Answer:
I would check for memory leaks to see if all objects are destructed at the right time.
I would also examine the usage of pointers to see if they point to the right addresses.
The program logic should be also looked at as well all inputs.
I would test the program on other machine to make sure it's not a single machine's fault.

Book Answer:
1. Random Variable
2. Uninitialized Variable
3. Memory Leak
4. External Dependencies

We should learn as much as we can about the program and start isolating working parts of it
