11.5 Test an ATM
How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

Questions:
	- What type of an ATM?
		- cash withdrawal, notes and coin deposit, cardless transactions...
	- Where would it be situated?
		- bank branches, on the streets, in shopping malls, undercover...
	- Who are the users?
	- How often the ATM are used throughout a day/year?
	- What are the possible transactions and currencies?
	- How is it built?
	- Do we test just the software, or hardware and the ATM's physical and mechanical
	  conditions as well?

I would do some manual testing using the ATM while being
connected to the system and monitoring the transactions I make.

We could just pretend to be the ATM's API to automate complex test scenarios.
We would have to test some (almost) concurrent transactions to see how it behaves.
We would need to tests whether the ATM is reliable (still performs as expected
when the banking system is under heavy load).
