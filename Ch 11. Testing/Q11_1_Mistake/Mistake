11.1 Mistake
Find the mistake(s) in the following code:

unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
	printf("%d\n", i);
	

My Answer:
1. Java doesn't have 'unsigned int' type.
2. 'i' should be declared inside the for loop if it's not used on the outside of its scope.
3. Missing curly brackets around the for loop.
4. '--i' could be changed to 'i = i - 1' for code readability. 

Book Answer:
1. 'unsigned int' is, by definition, always greater than or equal to zero,
so the for loop condition will always be true, and it will loop infinitely
2. use %u in place of %d
