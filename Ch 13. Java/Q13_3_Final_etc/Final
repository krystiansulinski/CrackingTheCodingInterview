13.3 Q13_3_Final_etc, etc.: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

The keyword final defines an entity that can be only assigned once and always contains the same value.
If it points to an object, it cannot be reassigned, but the object can change values.
A final class cannot be sub-classed.
A final method cannot be overridden or hidden by subclasses.

Finally indicates end of try-catch clause that is always ran.

Finalize method is called on an object by a JVM garbage collector when it is no longer referenced
just before destroying the object. It should never be called directly.
